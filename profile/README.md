# Coastline Charging

**All-electric, mobile EV charging — built for the real world.**

Coastline Charging delivers fast, on-demand charging directly to EV drivers and fleets across Southern California.  
No waiting. No detours. Just seamless energy — when and where it’s needed most.

We’ve spent two years in the field, problem-solving obsessively, refining our systems, and supporting drivers every step of the way.  
The result is a lean, all-electric operation built for reliability, flexibility, and scale.

Now we’re preparing for the next chapter:
- A new mobile app (currently in development) to make access faster and simpler than ever.
- Open development toward interoperable infrastructure and community-aligned energy systems.

We’ll be using this space to:
- Document our tech architecture  
- Share early protocol specs  
- Explore integrations across EV, delivery, and distributed energy systems

Whether you're here to learn, contribute, or collaborate — welcome.
